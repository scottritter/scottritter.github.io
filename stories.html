					<h3>U.S. Supreme Court Halts Florida Ballot Recount in Win for Bush</h3>
					<p>By Scott Ritter</p>
					<p>Dow Jones News Service</p>
				</div>
				<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; A divided U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday said a Florida court erred when it ordered the recount of thousands of presidential ballots in the state, handing George W. Bush a potentially decisive victory in his quest for the White House.</p>
				<p>Seven of the justices concluded that the statewide ballot count ordered Friday by the Florida Supreme Court had constitutional problems that <q>demand a remedy.</q></p>
				<p>However, the justices disagreed on what that remedy should be. Five justices concluded that a recommendation by Justice Stephen Breyer &mdash; ordering a <q>constitutionally proper</q> recount with a Dec. 18 deadline, would violate Florida election law.</p>
				<p>Instead, the majority&rsquo;s decision, in Breyer&rsquo;s words, was <q>simply to reverse the lower court and halt the recount entirely.</q></p>
				<p><q>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion,</q> the court wrote.</p>
				<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling came in the form of an unsigned declaration from the court, along with five written opinions.</p>
				<p>The high court&rsquo;s ruling marks a major &mdash; and perhaps fatal &mdash; political blow to Vice President Al Gore&rsquo;s presidential hopes. The Democrats have other legal challenges pending, but with time running short they appear to be long shots.</p>
				<p>Tuesday is the date for naming Florida&rsquo;s 25 electors under a provision of federal law that shields them from a challenge in Congress. The Electoral College casts votes for president Dec. 18.</p>
				<p>The candidate who wins Florida will become the nation&rsquo;s 43rd president.</p>
				<p>In the ruling, the justices said the recount ordered by the Florida court lacked uniform standards. That meant voters would likely be treated differently depending on which county they lived in, a violation of the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s equal protection clause, they said.</p>
				<p><q>The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right,</q> the unsigned portion of the ruling said.</p>
				<p><q>The want of those rules here has led to unequal evaluation of ballots in various respects,</q> the court added.</p>
				<p>The issue before the justices was a decision from the Florida Supreme Court, which on a 4-3 vote Friday ordered statewide manual recounts of thousands of presidential ballots. Barely 24 hours later, the U.S. Supreme Court halted the counting and announced it would hear a Bush challenge to the state court ruling.</p>
				<p>When the counting stopped Saturday, an unofficial tally by the Associated Press put Bush&rsquo;s lead at 177 votes statewide. Six million Florida voters cast ballots on Nov. 7.</p>
				<p>The ruling broke down like this: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy made up a majority that found a constitutional problem &mdash; but one that had no remedy.</p>
				<p>Justice Breyer and Souter also had concerns with the court-ordered recount, but said those problems could be cured by setting uniform standards and allowing the recount to proceed until Dec. 18, when the Electoral College meets.</p>
				<p>Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H. Souter and Stephen Breyer filed dissents, which made up most of Tuesday&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
				<p>Indeed, Stevens wrote a blistering appraisal of the majority&rsquo;s ruling, saying it showed a unstated lack of confidence in the impariality of state judges who decide whether recounts should be held.</p>
				<p><q>Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today&rsquo;s decision,</q> Stevens wrote, joined by Ginsburg and Breyer.</p>
				<p><q>One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year&rsquo;s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear,</q> he added.  <q>It is the nation&rsquo;s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.</q></p>
				<p>Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas filed a separate concurring opinion, concluding that they had even more problems with the Florida recount.</p>
				<p>They contended that the state high court&rsquo;s interpretation of Florida election statues <q>distorted them beyond what a fair reading required, in violation of Article II</q> of the constitution, which says legislatures have the authority to select electors.</p>
				<p>They also argued that it violated federal law that provides electors a <q>safe harbor</q> from congressional challenge if the vote is held under laws enacted before election day.</p>
				<p>The Florida court <q>significantly departed from the statutory framework in place on November 7, and authorized open-ended further proceedings which could not be completed by December 12, thereby preventing a final determination by that date,</q> they said.</p>
				<p>Gore attorney David Boies argued Monday that the state court was simply interpreting the Florida election law <q>according to the legislature&rsquo;s designated <q>manner</q></q> for choosing the state&rsquo;s 25 electors.</p>
				<p>While the justices sent the case back to the Florida high court for further proceedings, it appeared that the order was simply boilerplate language that would have no practical impact.</p>
				<p>In a dissent, Justices Breyer and Souter said the court should have sent the case back to Florida with instructions to set uniform procedures for a recount.</p>
				<p><q>To recount these manually would be a tall order, but before this court stayed the effort to do that the courts of Florida were ready to do their best to get that job done,</q> Souter wrote.  <q>There is no justification for denying the state the opportunity to try to count all the disputed ballots now.</q></p>
				<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday halted the recount while it considered Gov. Bush&rsquo;s appeal. The justices heard arguments in the case barely 48 hours before issuing Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
				<p>Justice Ginsburg also filed a dissent, in which Stevens, Souter and Breyer joined in part.</p>
				<p><q>The extraordinary setting of this case has obscured the ordinary principle that dictates its proper resolution: Federal courts defer to state high courts&rsquo; interpretations of their states&rsquo; own laws,</q> she wrote.</p>
				<p>Justice Breyer, in a separate dissent, worried that the appearance of the court&rsquo;s split decision in the highly politicized case could undermine the public&rsquo;s confidence in the court itself.</p>
				<p><q>That confidence is a public treasure,</q> Breyer wrote.  <q>It has been built slowly over many years, some of which were marked by a Civil War and the tragedy of segregation. It is a vitally necessary ingredient of any successful effort to protect basic liberty and, indeed, the rule of law itself.</q></p>
				<p>The case is Bush vs. Gore, 00-949.</p>

					<h3>US Supreme Court Weighs Bush vs. Gore Arguments</h3>
					<p>By Scott Ritter</p>
					<p>Dow Jones News Service</p>
				</div>
				<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; Weighing a historic appeal that could decide the presidency, several U.S. Supreme Court justices Monday seemed skeptical of a Florida court ruling that ordered the recount of thousands of contested Florida election ballots.</p>
				<p>Some justices worried that the recount standards varied from county to county and expressed concern that ballots might be treated differently depending on were a voter lived.</p>
				<p><q>That&rsquo;s bothering a lot of us here,</q> said Justice David H. Souter, who&rsquo;s often aligned with the court&rsquo;s more liberal jurists.</p>
				<p>Still, it was far from clear how the justices will decide the case. Souter and Justice Stephen Breyer early on in the session wondered aloud whether the case could be returned to the Florida courts with instructions to adopt a uniform ballot counting standard.</p>
				<p>Attorneys for Texas Governor George Bush and Vice President Al Gore sought to make their respective cases during 90 minutes of oral argument, the second time this month that the nation&rsquo;s high court has meet in an extraordinary session to consider disputed presidential ballots.</p>
				<p>At issue is a decision from the Florida Supreme Court, which on a 4-3 vote Friday ordered statewide manual recounts of thousands of presidential ballots. Barely 24 hours later, the U.S. Supreme Court halted the counting and announced it would hear a Bush challenge to the state court ruling.</p>
				<p>Bush&rsquo;s attorney, Theodore Olson, argued that Florida&rsquo;s high court ruling ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution and federal law when it ordered statewide recounts. David Boies, who represents Gore, urged the justices to allow the hand counts to resume.</p>
				<p>A ruling in the case, Bush vs. Gore, 00-949, could come quickly.</p>
				<p>Arguing for the Texas governor, Olson told the justices that the state high court <q>issued a new, wholesale, post-election revision of Florida election law</q> when it ordered statewide recounts.</p>
				<p>Federal law provides a <q>safe harbor</q> that protects state electors appointed under laws in existance prior to election day. And Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution says that each state shall appoint its electors <q>in such a manner as the legislature thereof may direct.</q></p>
				<p>Justice John Paul Stevens wondered aloud whether the Florida Supreme Court did indeed make significant changes to state election law.</p>
				<p>Souter suggested that the Florida court may have simply been interpreting the statute. If that was the case, <q>than I don&rsquo;t see how you can find an Article II violation,</q> he told Olson.</p>
				<p>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he was troubled by the possibility that the court changed the election law after Nov. 7. He said that the Florida justices effectively shortened the period under which ballots could be <q>contested.</q></p>
				<p><q>Seems to me that the legislature could not have done that by a statute without it being a new law,</q> he told Boies, suggesting that the Florida Supreme Court couldn&rsquo;t either.  <q>I&rsquo;m troubled by that.</q></p>
				<p>Perhaps the most interesting scenario suggested during Monday&rsquo;s extraordinary session was the possibility that the high court could craft ballot-counting standards and order the recount to continue.</p>
				<p>The Bush camp has argued that the existing standard &mdash; based on figuring out a voter&rsquo;s <q>intent</q> &mdash; is far too subjective.</p>
				<p>Breyer asked Bush attorney Olson what standards would be fair.</p>
				<p><q>Penetration of the ballot card would be required,</q> Olson responded. Souter asked whether the Leon County Circuit Court &mdash; where this case was originally heard and which hears</p>
				<p>election contests in the state &mdash; could formulate uniform recount rules.</p>
				<p><q>That would be feasible, wouldn&rsquo;t it,</q> he asked.</p>
				<p><q>I think it would be feasible,</q> Olson said.</p>
				<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested that the <q>voter intent</q> standard was valid because <q>at least those words come from the legislature.</q> But Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor said voters should have followed the rules in the first place and made sure their ballots were completely punched.</p>
				<p><q>Why isn&rsquo;t the standard the one that voters are instructed to follow, for heaven&rsquo;s sake,</q> O&rsquo;Connor asked.</p>
				<p>Boies, Gore&rsquo;s attorney, argued that the Florida Supreme Court ruled properly when it ordered the recount. The court&rsquo;s decision, he said, didn&rsquo;t rewrite state election law.</p>
				<p>Boies faced uncertain prospects during the 45 minutes he was allotted to argue Gore&rsquo;s case. Five of the high court&rsquo;s nine justices voted Saturday to halt the recount, with Justice Antonin Scalia saying that the majority <q>believe that the petitioner (Bush) has a substantial probability of success.</q></p>
				<p>There was little sign from Monday&rsquo;s questioning that their positions had changed.</p>
				<p>Scalia was joined by the court&rsquo;s more conservative leaning justices: Clarence Thomas, Kennedy, O&rsquo;Connor and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.</p>
				<p>Stevens, Souter, Breyer and Ginsburg dissented.</p>
				<p><q>The Florida court&rsquo;s ruling reflects the basic principle, inherent in our Constitution and our democracy, that every legal vote counts,</q> Stevens wrote.</p>
				<p>Watching Monday&rsquo;s argument was an assortment of Capitol Hill lawmakers and former White House cabinet officials. Children of Gore and Richard Cheney, the Republican vice presidential candidate, were also on hand.</p>
				<p>The serious mood in the courtroom was broken on a couple of occasions when Miami attorney Joseph Klock twice misidentified justices to whom he was directing remarks. At one point, Scalia jumped in with a question, prefacing it by saying, <q>Mr. Klock, I&rsquo;m Scalia.</q> The courtroom erupted with laughter.</p>

					<h3>High Court Upholds 'Miranda' Ruling On Suspects' Rights</h3>
					<p>By Scott Ritter</p>
					<p>Dow Jones News Service</p>
				</div>
				<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; The Supreme Court Monday reaffirmed its landmark Miranda ruling, saying police should continue to abide by the 30-year practice of warning suspects of their right to remain silent.</p>
				<p>Ruling 7-2, the justices struck down a seldom-used 1968 statute that was meant to reverse the high court&rsquo;s Miranda decision two years earlier. Known as Section 3501, the law allowed prosecutors to use a voluntary confession even if police didn't warn a suspect of his Miranda rights.</p>
				<p>Writing for the majority, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the Miranda warnings &mdash; which include the right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning &mdash; have a constitutional dimension that can't be undone by Congress. </p>
				<p><q>We conclude that Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively,</q> Rehnquist wrote.</p>
				<p>He added: <q>We decline to overrule Miranda ourselves.</q></p>
				<p>Much of the high-profile debate centered on whether the Miranda rules have a &ldquo;constitutional dimension&rdquo; that &ldquo;cannot be superseded merely by legislation,&rdquo; as the Justice Department argued.</p>
				<p>Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman said Miranda was drawn from the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s protection against self-incrimination. Waxman and James W. Hundley, who represented the robbery suspect in the appeal, noted that the Supreme Court has consistently applied Miranda to cases arising in state courts. If Miranda wasn&lsquo;t based on a constitutional right, then the high court couldn&rsquo;t require local police to follow its rules, they reasoned.</p>
				<p>The justices agreed, and pointed out that Miranda has been applied by the courts for years. They said there was no reason to overrule it now.</p>
				<p><q>Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our popular culture,</q> Rehnquist wrote for the majority. </q>While we have overruled our precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings...we do not believe that this has happened to the Miranda decision.</q></p>
				<p>Rehnquist is one of the court&rsquo;s more conservative justices, so it came as a surprise that he wrote the ruling upholding Miranda.</p>
				<p>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who often find themselves aligned with the chief justice, dissented.</p>
				<p><q>Today&rsquo;s judgment converts Miranda from a milestone of judicial overreaching into one of judicial arrogance,</q> Scalia wrote.</p>
				<p>Section 3501 has been largely ignored over the years. But it was revived last year in a case involving a Maryland bank robbery suspect named Charles Thomas Dickerson. Dickerson had asked a judge to throw out statements he made to federal agents at an FBI field office in Washington. He said the statements were made before investigators read him his rights, in violation of Miranda.</p>
				<p>A district court agreed.

					<h3>U.S. Appeals Court Rejects Challenge To Assault Gun Ban</h3>
					<p>By Scott Ritter</p>
					<p>Dow Jones News Service</p>
				</div>
				<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; A U.S. appeals court Friday upheld a 1994 U.S. law banning assault-style weapons, rejecting a challenge by two gun makers who said they were unfairly singled out by the ban.</p>
				<p>Navegar Inc. and Penn Arms Inc. also argued that Congress had exceeded its powers to regulate interstate commerce when it crafted the statute.</p>
				<p>Three weapons specifically banned by the law &mdash; the Intratec TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22 &mdash; were manufactured by Miami-based Navegar. Penn&rsquo;s Street Sweeper and Striker semiautomatic shotguns were also among those banned.</p>
				<p>An attorney for the companies, Richard E. Gardiner of Fairfax, Va., said the ruling will likely be appealed to the nation&rsquo;s top court.</p>
				<p><q>The Supreme Court, particularly in the last several years, has not been loathe to remind Congress that there are limits to its powers,</q> Gardiner said.</p>
				<p>The companies challenged the law in 1995, in part arguing that Congress ran afoul of the Constitution&rsquo;s commerce clause by meddling in an area traditionally left to the states. The appeals panel, however, disagreed.</p>
				<p><q>Congress was well aware that there was significant interstate traffic in semiautomatic assault weapons and that state laws and existing federal firearms regulations were inadequate to control the flow of these weapons across state lines,</q> Circuit Judge Patricia M. Wald wrote for the panel.</p>
				<p>The gun makers also argued that the law was an unconstitutional <q>bill of attainder</q> because it specifically singled them out for punishment without benefit of a trial.</p>
				<p>The obscure constitutional provision was meant to protect against legislative punishments such as a death sentence or imprisonment, and laws that bar certain people &mdash; Communist Party members, for example &mdash; from specific jobs, the court noted.</p>
				<p><q>In this case, the ban on semiautomatic assault weapons raises no concern that Congress is singling out (the gun makers) for punishment because they are disloyal or disfavored,</q> Wald wrote.  <q>Congress has rather singled out certain weapons as dangerous and disproportionately linked to crime.</q></p>
				<p>Wald was joined in the opinion by Circuit Judges Laurence H. Silberman and David S. Tatel.</p>
				<p>The ban left both companies with big inventories of gun parts for weapons they could no longer make. Navegar held in its inventory more than 40,000 TEC-DC9 and TEC-22 frames and thousands of dollars in parts. Penn, based in Punxsutawney, Pa., was left with $58,000 worth of parts for its Striker 12 series of shotguns.</p>

					<h3>Bells Urge Appeals Ct To Scrap Key Telecom-Law Provisions</h3>
					<p>By Scott Ritter</p>
					<p>Dow Jones News Service</p>
				</div>
				<p>NEW ORLEANS &mdash; A trio of Baby Bells urged a federal appeals court Thursday to uphold a ruling that scrapped key parts of the landmark 1996 telecommunications-reform law.</p>
				<p>SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), along with Bell Atlantic Corp. (BEL) and U S West Inc. (USW), say the law unfairly hinders efforts by the regional Bell companies to enter the lucrative long-distance market. A federal judge in Texas last year agreed, and declared sections of the law unconstitutional.</p>
				<p><q>Of all the options to it, Congress selected the one the Constitution foreclosed on for 200 years,</q> Harvard professor Laurence Tribe told a three judge panel from the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here.  <q>It seems to me Congress chose the worst of all worlds here.</q></p>
				<p>At issue is a suit filed last July by SBC, the San Antonio-based Baby Bell. SBC argued that the law amounted to an unconstitutional <q>bill of attainder</q> by singling out the regional Bells for punishment. Local carriers that were never part of the Bell system, like GTE Corp. (GTE), were free to offer long-distance calling, SBC noted.</p>
				<p>But the nation&rsquo;s top antitrust cop, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, said the Bells weren&rsquo;t being punished by the law&rsquo;s long-distance provisions. Indeed, he told the panel, the carriers got some <q>real tangible benefits</q> when Congress passed the law.</p>
				<p><q>They got some benefits, they got some burdens,</q> said Klein.  <q>Now they want to connect that to a bill of attainder?</q></p>
				<p>The Federal Communications Commission, through the Justice Department, appealed the New Year&rsquo;s Eve ruling from U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall of Dallas. Long-distance carriers including MCI Communications Corp. (MCIC), AT&T Corp. (T) and Sprint Corp. (FON) are backing the government&rsquo;s challenge.</p>
				<p>Kendall&rsquo;s ruling would have allowed the SBC to jump into the long-distance market even before the carrier had taken steps called for in the law to open its local calling network to rivals. Kendall in February agreed to freeze his decision while the case winds its way through the appeals process.</p>
				<p>The appeals panel heard more than an hour of arguments Thursday afternoon. The judges, all Republicans, peppered both sides with questions but offered little to signal which way they might ultimately rule.</p>
				<p>Still, a hint of skepticism greeted some of the Bells&rsquo; arguments. In an exchange with Tribe, Circuit Judge E. Grady Jolly suggested that the long-fought legislation was welcomed by the regional Bells once it was finally passed.</p>
				<p><q>It&rsquo;s like a quid pro quo,</q> Jolly said.  <q>You gave up something, you got something. How can a quid pro quo ever be punishment?</q></p>
				<p>Tribe responded: <q>You don&rsquo;t trade constitutional rights.</q> He said the Bells made well known their objections to the long-distance provisions in the law, but were pleased with the rest of the legislation.</p>
