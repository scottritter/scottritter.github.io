			<h1>scott ritter</h1>
			<p>I'm a reporter, editor, designer and wannabe mapmaker @thedayct and theday.com in southeastern Connecticut.</p>
			<p>This is version 2.0 of the site. My son Charlie wrote most of the code, while good-naturedly trying to help me improve my html and css skills.</p>
			<p>We decided on DM Sans and EB Garamond for typography, though lots of other fonts were in the running.</p>
			<p>The homepage photo &mdash; fresh line on the deck of a ferry in Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick &mdash; is mine. 
				The stories and pages are copyright Dow Jones & Co. and Day Publishing Co.</p>
			<p>The special projects page are pubs I designed and edited for The Day.</p>
			<p>Coastlines is a project I'm working on to reproduce vintage maps of Groton, where I live and play. 
				(Many thanks to Washington cartographer and designer Sarah Bell, whose BellTopo Sans works beautifully with these maps.)</p>
			<p>Charlie and I are still tweaking the site.</p>
			<p>Hope you like it.</p>
