			<h1>scott ritter</h1>
				<p>I'm a reporter, editor, designer and wannabe map maker @thedayct and theday.com in southeastern Connecticut.</p> 
				<p>This is version 2.0 of my website. My son Charlie wrote most of the code, while good-naturedly trying to help me improve my html and css skills.</p>
				<p>We decided on DM Sans and EB Garamond for typography, though lots of other fonts were in the running.</p>
				<p>Homepage photo &mdash; fresh line on the deck of a ferry in xxx &mdash; is mine. The tree photos are mine as well, shot on the 11th fairway at Sheneccossett Golf Course in Groton, Conn., with an iPhone and a variety of filters. The stories and pages are copyright Dow Jones & Co. and Day Publishing Co. </p>
				<p>Charlie and I are still tweaking the site.</p>
				<p>Hope you like it.</p>
