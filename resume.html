      I’m a reporter, editor, designer and wannabe
      mapmaker <a href="https://twitter.com/thedayct">@thedayct</a>
      and <a href="https://www.theday.com/">theday.com</a> in
      southeastern Connecticut.

      This is version 2.0 of the site. My daughter Lily wrote most of
      the code, while good-naturedly trying to help me improve my html
      and css skills.

    <p>
      We decided on DM Sans and EB Garamond for typography, though
      lots of other fonts were in the running.

      The homepage photo — fresh line on the deck of a ferry in Bay of
      Fundy, New Brunswick — is mine. The stories and pages are
      copyright Dow Jones & Co. and Day Publishing Co.

      The special projects page are pubs I designed and edited for The
      Day.

      Coastlines is a project I’m working on to reproduce vintage maps
      of Groton, where I live and play. Many thanks to Washington
      cartographer and designer
      <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahbellmaps">Sarah Bell</a>,
      whose BellTopo Sans works beautifully with these maps.
    </p>
    <p>Lily and I are still tweaking the site.</p>
    <p>Hope you like it.</p>
