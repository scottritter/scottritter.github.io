			<h1>scott ritter</h1>
				<p>I'm a reporter, editor, designer and wannabe map maker @thedayct and theday.com in southeastern Connecticut.</p> 
				<p>This is version 2.0 of my website. My son Charlie (who wrote most of the code) and I are still tweaking it.<p>
				<p>We decided on DM Sans and EB Garamond for typography, though lots of other fonts were in the running.</p>
				<p>Hope you like it.</p>
