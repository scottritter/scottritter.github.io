			<h1>scott ritter</h1>
			<p>I'm a reporter, editor, designer and wannabe mapmaker @thedayct and theday.com in southeastern Connecticut.</p> 
			<p>This is version 2.0 of the site. My son Charlie wrote most of the code, while good-naturedly trying to help me improve my html and css skills.</p>
			<p>We decided on DM Sans and EB Garamond for typography, though lots of other fonts were in the running.</p>
			<p>
				Homepage photo &mdash; fresh line on the deck of a ferry in Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick &mdash; is mine.
				The tree photos are mine as well, shot on the 11th fairway at Sheneccossett Golf
				Course in Groton, Conn., with an iPhone and a variety of filters. The stories and
				pages are copyright Dow Jones & Co. and Day Publishing Co.
			</p>
			<p>Charlie and I are still tweaking the site.</p>
			<p>Hope you like it.</p>
